            <h2>What is Java?</h2>
            <p>Java is a programming language that implements the paradigm of <strong>object oriented</strong> programming.</p>
            <p>It was originally developped to be run independently from the OS.</p>
            <p>It is very powefull and used in many domains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop applications</li>
                <li>Mobile applications</li>
                <li>Back-end of web applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Classes and Objects</h2>
            <p>Java language is based on classes and objects and their relationship. But what are they?</p>
            <h3>Classes</h3>
            <p>Classes are <em>abstractions</em> that we can implement to simulate the standard behavior of an object. It is a standard pattern of a abstract idea.</p>
            <h3>Objects</h3> 
            <p>Objects are instances of a class. They have their own properties and attributes. Besides that, objects are unique and are a concrete type of a class.</p>

            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>The symbol of the Java language is a coffee mark, in reference to the Java islands. The programmers loved the coffee from that island and it usually made them very excited, so they named the language after that.</p>
            <p>Thats what happens when you let programmers do they work... ðŸ˜€ </p>
